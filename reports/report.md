# ZumaText Project Report

Uma Desai & Zhengyang Feng

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build our own text editor that effectively implements all of the basic features expected of a minimal editor. Our stretch goal is to add more advanced features that build off of the basic Kilo tutorial. 

## Learning Goals

We want to:

- Learn new C tools and get more comfortable using the language under UNIX environment.

- Learn how to build a text editor from scratch using system calls and other functions.

- Learn how to communicate the program with keyboard and mouse like emacs editor, including shortcuts.

## Resources

The primary resource we used for getting started on the foundation of the project is the Kilo Snaptoken tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/. We also frequently referenced StackOverflow and the following sites for more context on implementing text editors in C:

- http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/text_editor.html

- http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/text-editors-algorithms-and-architecture/184408975

## Outcomes

We were successful in building a text editor with vim-like interface and emacs-like shortcuts. We implemented each of the following capabilities in our text editor:

- User interface

- Input and output

- Status bar 

**Try it for yourself!** To run our text editor, clone our repository, navigate to the editor folder, and run the following commands in the Unix command line:

make

./zuma [filename]


## Reflection

Even though we did not meet our stretch goal of implementing advanced features of a text editor in our program, we arrived at our original goal of implementing all of the basic features of a minimal editor. During this process, we were not only able to develop a fully functioning text editor, but also learn many new C tools by using UNIX libraries like termios, fcntl, errno, and ioctl. We were also able to practice implementing concepts weâ€™ve been learning in class, such as using Makefiles, structs, enums, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.
