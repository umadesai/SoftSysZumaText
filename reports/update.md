## ZumaText Project Update

Uma Desai & Zhengyang Feng

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build our own text editor that effectively implements all of the basic features expected of a minimal editor. Our stretch goal is to add more advanced features that build off of the basic Kilo tutorial. 


## Learning Goals
We want to:

Learn new C tools and get more comfortable using the language in a UNIX environment.

Learn how to build a text editor from scratch using system calls and other functions.

Learn how to communicate with the program with a keyboard and mouse like the emacs editor, including shortcuts.


## First Steps & Resources
The primary resource we will be using for getting started on the foundation of the project is the Kilo Snaptoken tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/. We have started to build our text editor while following the tutorial, and once the basic features are all fully functioning, we will look for some additional references for the advanced features we hope to attempt.


## Current Progress
We have both been working on the input and output functionalities following the Kilo tutorial. The text editor has a raw prototype now, with simple shortcuts, basic response for input and output, and support for advanced functions in communication with the text file. Our definition of done for each of these features is that they have been implemented in commented code, understood by both team members, and tested for functionality.


## Next Steps
Finish implementing the features from the Kilo tutorial.

Research and explore other interesting feature(s) we would like to implement.

Implement our own feature in the text editor.
