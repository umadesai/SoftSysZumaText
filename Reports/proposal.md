## ZumaText Project Proposal

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build our own text editor that effectively implements all of the basic features expected of a minimal editor. Our stretch goal is to add more advanced features that build off of the basic Kilo tutorial.


 ## Learning Goals
We want to:

Learn C and get more comfortable using the language.

Learn how to build a text editor from scratch.

Learn how to communicate the program with short cuts.


## Resources
The primary resource we will be using for getting started on the foundation of the project is the Kilo Snaptoken tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/. We hope to build off of the tutorial towards the end of the project, and will likely need to find more resources to help us at that stage.


## First Steps

Complete the setup of the project.

Read the tutorial.

Enter raw modes.

Both of us will go through all the steps.

### Definition of done

Executable code pushed to github.

Having an understanding of the concepts covered in the steps.

Being able to observe the changes made in the editor.
