Your project proposal should answer the following questions:
1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.
2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?
3) What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?
4) What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?


## Goal
The goal of this project is to build our own text editor that effectively implements all of the basic features expected of a minimal editor. Our stretch goal is to add more advanced features that build off of the basic Kilo tutorial.


 ## Learning Goals
We want to:
Learn C and get more comfortable using the language
Learn how to build a text editor from scratch
Learn how to communicate the program with short cuts


## Resources
The primary resource we will be using for getting started on the foundation of the project is the Kilo Snaptoken tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/. We hope to build off of the tutorial towards the end of the project, and will likely need to find more resources to help us at that stage.


## First Steps
Initialize the project
Read the tutorial
Enter raw modes
Both of us will go through all the steps.

### Definition of done
Executable code pushed to github
Understand the concepts covered in first steps
Being able to type something in the editor
